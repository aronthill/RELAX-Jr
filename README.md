# RELAX-Jr
The Reduction of Electroencephalographic Artifacts for Juvenile Recordings (RELAX-Jr) is an open-source EEGLAB toolbox for automated preprocessing of EEG data. It was designed to extend the capabilities of the RELAX preprocessing software to enable efficient cleaning of EEG data recorded in children using Geodesic SensorNets.
